### About Me
I'm Jahzy a chemist by training, I have about 12 years experience in the field of science and research, but I love learning about the world from the big to the small. In early 2025 I completed an intensive 3 month Web Development Bootcamp and I'm working on building up my software development toolkit. I am eager to leverage my broad project based skill set to solve problems and build solutions in a dedicated software development role.
