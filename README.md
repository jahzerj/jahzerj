-##  Like chemistry, software development isn't magic, but it sure feels like it when it works.  Letâ€™s make the kind of software that _feels_ like magic!


# This is my Github page, there are many like it. But this one is mine.
## Let's build something together!

### About Me
I'm Jahzy a chemist by training with about 12 years experience in the field of science and research, but I love learning about the world from the big to the small. In early 2025 I completed an intensive 3 month Web Development Bootcamp and I'm working on building up my software development toolkit. I am eager to leverage my broad project-based skillset to solve problems and build solutions in a dedicated software development role.
